        We exist to bridge the last mile of enterprise AI—the part where prototypes meet
        integrations, governance, and value metrics. Each service below is a focused play
        that addresses a specific failure pattern we have seen inside large organizations.

        Wherever you are on the journey—prioritizing use cases, hardening a pilot,
        building a platform layer, or operationalizing AI risk—we measure success by
        systems that ship and stay live.
